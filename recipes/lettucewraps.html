    <h3>Chicken Lettuce Wraps</h3>
    <p>I am such a sucker for lettuce wraps. They are so low in carbs so I become a bottomless pit, stuffing my face without any kind of guilt. And when it’s an exact PF Chang’s replica that can be made in 20 minutes or less – well, that just means I’m having this 5 times a week.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground chicken</li>
        <li>2 cloves minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 onion diced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup hoisin sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger</li>
        <li>1 table spoon sriracha </li>
        <li>1 8oz can whole water chestnuts drained and diced</li>
        <li>2 green onions thinly sliced</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1-2 heads butter lettuce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium high heat. Add ground chicken and cook until browned, about 3-5 minutes, making sure to crumble the chicken as it cooks; drain excess fat.</li>
        <li>Stir in garlic, onion, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, ginger and Sriracha until onions have become translucent, about 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in chestnuts and green onions until tender, about 1-2 minutes; season with salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
        <li>To serve, spoon several tablespoons of the chicken mixture into the center of a lettuce leaf, taco-style.</li>
    </ol>
